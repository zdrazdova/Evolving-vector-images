Information
===========

This project contains information, instructions and documentation for programs developed in bachelor thesis Generation of Vector images using Evolutionary Algorithms. 

We developed three algorithms for generating user-friendly vector images via evolutionary algorithms: 

Triangulation alg.

Multi-objective optimization alg.

Connecting rectangles alg.

We used DEAP package - Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (http://pypi.org/project/deap/)

This project has two main parts: instructions and documentation. 

Instructions
------------
In instructions we describe how to work with the three programs. This includes initial parameter settings, running the program and changing the parameters. 

Documentation
-------------
In this part we present autogenerated documentation. It offers information about all classes and methods. For each method parameters and return values are explained.
